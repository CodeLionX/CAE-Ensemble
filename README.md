# CAE-Ensemble

Code for the paper Time Series Outlier Detection with Diversity-Driven Convolutional Ensembles

How to run the model:
 * Execute [cae_ensemble.py](cae_ensemble.py) specifying the model parameters, for example:
 `python cae_ensemble.py --dataset 81 --diversity_factor 1 --beta_transfer 0.5 --rolling_size 16 --ensemble_members 20 --epochs 200`
 * The complete list of parameters is available at lines 963--1005 in [cae_ensemble.py](cae_ensemble.py). The model parameters are the ones detailed in 1.
 * The data sets number is related to the specification in lines 1064--1169.
 * The structure for the data input is defined in [data_provider.py](./utils/data_provider.py).
 * Results will be inserted in a database, calculations, and connections are managed in [metrics_insert.py](./utils/metrics_insert.py).


Baselines:
 * Use the same structure as the CAE-Ensemble model, just using their specific parameters.
